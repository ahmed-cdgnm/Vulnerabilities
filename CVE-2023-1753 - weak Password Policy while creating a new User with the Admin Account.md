1. I was able to detect weak Password Policy while allowing an administrator to create a new account.
2. Lets create an account, set the Password to 1 and login with it.
3. As you can see its number 1. When i click set it will not accept
4. We need to specify that the user will change his password after login.
5. Then the password field will be hidden and the password 1 will be accepted.
6. User created successfully with a weak password policy and password 1 -> lets try to login.
